performance is important and should be budgeted for at every stage of product
development, what benefits it holds for businesses and products, and the
negatives of poor performance. Now, let’s talk about the problems of web
performance; what makes sites slow.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-sites-slow">What makes sites slow?</h2>
<p>No doubt, there’s a ton of reasons why websites are slow, some of which are
case-specific. I like to look at these factors from two perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user perspective</li>
<li>the developer perspective</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, the <em>user</em> and the <em>developer</em> are the two main parties involved in this
discussion; all other factors that impact web performance like the network from
which the site is accessed, the hardware specs of the device, and the software
fall under the <em>user</em> factor. Same way, developers are responsible for whatever
impacts performance on the tech part of it. So, basically, these two guys are
the players in this game.</p>
<p>That being said, in this article, we’ll look at things less from <em>user</em>
perspective, and focus on the development side because most of the problems come
from there, and to move forward, developers have to build with the users in mind
and the various real-life situations they could be caught up in because we
definitely can’t control them; we can’t move all our users to a luxury place
with super-fast internet connection and great devices — that’s unrealistic. So,
let’s jump right into what makes sites on the internet slow today.</p>
<p>Apart from network, hardware, and software limitations which are user factors,
let’s actually talk about the technical causes of poor performance on the front
end.</p>
<h3 id="1-third-party-resources-and-scripts">1. Third-party resources and scripts</h3>
<p>It’s an absolutely normal and almost inevitable practice to have third-party
resources and scripts on our sites because we most of the time consume
third-party content and services whether it’s analytics, ads, social media
plugins, framework/library resources, we use them.</p>
<p>However, so many times, the authors of these third-party resources just tell us
to plug in their resources to our sites: resources that might depend on other
resources all the way down or might be poorly developed, and then they serve us.
The fact, however, remains that most of these assets are the leading cause of
performance problems on the web because of course, we didn’t build them, we
don’t know how they were built, we do not own them, all we want is their
services and we can’t determine the quality of these services, we can only
assess them and act based on the information.</p>
<p>It’s sad news that third-party resources today have taken over control of tons
of sites that they start to have unintended (sometimes malicious) side effects,
and as developers, most of the time we’re just lazy to take it back. It's very
common to see sites include a huge third-party resource, and then end up using a
very minimal portion of it, say 5% e.g including a 20kb library only to end up
using a component that’s barely worth a kilobyte. That's usually not a great
idea as most of these things can easily be implemented in-house with just a
little bit extra work.</p>
<h3 id="2-heavy-assets-and-resources">2. Heavy assets and resources</h3>
<p>We all have that one big file on our sites – the one big JavaScript asset
or the pretty 1MB image from Unsplash. JavaScript is on top of the list of
frontend resources that impact performance negatively, followed by images and
really, it’s difficult to keep track of these things when everyone is in a rush
and hell-bent on results so we under-prioritize or forget about optmizing for
performance, something that affects our users directly. Users know when your
site is slow, they also know most times what sites consume a lot of their mobile
data.</p>
<p>Engineers write code and craft experiences they find pleasing which more often
than not is at the expense of the user — forgetting what the user needs and what
they perceive to be a great experience. The user has no idea how fancy your code
is or what shiny new tech you're using, they just want to be able to use your
product and have a great experience doing that. And so, if your site is not
accessible quickly, you do not even get the chance to show anything to the user.</p>
<h3 id="3-excessive-http-requests">3. Excessive HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>Get! Post! Frontend developers, we love to do that a lot: consuming APIs and all
— it’s fun actually, being able to communicate with a web server, that’s pretty
incredible, right?</p>
<p>Well, yes, it is but sure comes at a cost. Sending requests back and forth can
quickly become overwhelming for a web server to handle. Imagine for a moment
that you’re going to get a snack one day at the office and then, a superior
calls and says “hey, on your way, please get me some venti iced skinny hazelnut
macchiato, sugar-free syrup, extra shot, light ice, no whip coffee”. Extremely
confusing, yeah?</p>
<p>Similar can happen with your server when making requests. If you observe from
that order, the entire purpose and what matters to you the most is getting your
snack, just the way your users want to <em>use</em> your product — they want to satisfy
themselves. Too bad their superior (engineers in this case) took that privilege
away from them. You know how tough it can be to say no to that – same way
the server can’t say no to your multiple requests. It just must (or at least
attempt to) process the requests regardless of how complicated it is.</p>
<p>Your user might not need all the junks and stuff you’re fetching for them on the
initial load, they need what matters, and you’re in place to answer those
questions. Identify the things you’d want to have on your screen quickly if you
were the user.</p>
<h3 id="4-poor-code-quality">4. Poor Code Quality</h3>
<p>Everyone likes to hop on their computer to start writing code which often gets
us distracted to the point we forget to ask ourselves essential questions like
“Am I doing it the right way?”, “Can this be done better?”, “What are the
implications of doing it this way?”.</p>
<p>A lot from the code quality can affect the performance of your site or product
as an entity. Whether you’re implementing a functionality that should take 10
lines of code in 50 lines, there’s so much dead code, or you’re just writing the
code or using a tool in a way that it’s much slower to function; they all impact
performance. For example, having excessive unused code bumps up file sizes which
could delay HTTP requests and in turn, affect performance.</p>
<p>In fact, all the points listed previously in one way or the other fall under the
quality of code you’re delivering and how knowledgeable a developer might be
with regards to performance. Your JavaScript, CSS, HTML and other applications
on the backend contribute to performance directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>There are some industry standards and practices that should be followed while
building sites. Don’t write code that “just works™”. You should consider if
you’re actually solving that problem in the most efficient way.</p>
<h2 id="5-inadequate-server-resources">5. Inadequate server resources</h2>
<p>One critical factor often overlooked is the capabilities of the web server
behind a frontend. Nearly all articles and discussions about performance are
usually focused on the frontend. Now, while that isn't wrong as most of the work
is usually on the frontend, the server that powers a frontend can also greatly
affect overall performance.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, you could have a pretty fast frontend but if your server fails to
respond on time, the frontend never even makes it. So, what do I mean? Some
servers have very high <a href="https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TTFB</a> (Time to First
Byte) which is the time it takes for the client get the first byte of response
data from a server after an HTTP request, and so if that server's hardware (CPU,
RAM etc) is inferior or insufficient and it takes long (more than 600ms on an
average network) to get a response for just the main document request, that's a
prolonged page load and so your user just stares at a blank screen for seconds
with no sign of progress which can be really frustrating. Now, even when we get
a response for that main document request, subsequent resources like scripts,
css and images (all of which point to the server) still have to get their first
byte of response data and fully download which can really slow things down.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that you have a clearer view on why performance matters and the several
factors that influence performance, including a few instances of not-so-good
practices, in the final part of this series, we’ll talk about known and tested
strategies to tackle these problems.</p>
<p>In summary, how we build what we build matters because that’s a huge part of the
product no matter what it's later transformed to. That’s what we serve users,
and so priority should be given to what matters to the user, and not how quickly
we can achieve something that might not be the best experience for users.</p>

Now, let’s talk about the problems of web\nperformance; what makes sites slow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"what-makes-sites-slow\"\u003EWhat makes sites slow?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo doubt, there’s a ton of reasons why websites are slow, some of which are\ncase-specific. I like to look at these factors from two perspectives:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe user perspective\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe developer perspective\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EReally, the \u003Cem\u003Euser\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and the \u003Cem\u003Edeveloper\u003C\u002Fem\u003E are the two main parties involved in this\ndiscussion; all other factors that impact web performance like the network from\nwhich the site is accessed, the hardware specs of the device, and the software\nfall under the \u003Cem\u003Euser\u003C\u002Fem\u003E factor. Same way, developers are responsible for whatever\nimpacts performance on the tech part of it. So, basically, these two guys are\nthe players in this game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, in this article, we’ll look at things less from \u003Cem\u003Euser\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\nperspective, and focus on the development side because most of the problems come\nfrom there, and to move forward, developers have to build with the users in mind\nand the various real-life situations they could be caught up in because we\ndefinitely can’t control them; we can’t move all our users to a luxury place\nwith super-fast internet connection and great devices — that’s unrealistic. So,\nlet’s jump right into what makes sites on the internet slow today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EApart from network, hardware, and software limitations which are user factors,\nlet’s actually talk about the technical causes of poor performance on the front\nend.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-third-party-resources-and-scripts\"\u003E1. Third-party resources and scripts\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s an absolutely normal and almost inevitable practice to have third-party\nresources and scripts on our sites because we most of the time consume\nthird-party content and services whether it’s analytics, ads, social media\nplugins, framework\u002Flibrary resources, we use them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, so many times, the authors of these third-party resources just tell us\nto plug in their resources to our sites: resources that might depend on other\nresources all the way down or might be poorly developed, and then they serve us.\nThe fact, however, remains that most of these assets are the leading cause of\nperformance problems on the web because of course, we didn’t build them, we\ndon’t know how they were built, we do not own them, all we want is their\nservices and we can’t determine the quality of these services, we can only\nassess them and act based on the information.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s sad news that third-party resources today have taken over control of tons\nof sites that they start to have unintended (sometimes malicious) side effects,\nand as developers, most of the time we’re just lazy to take it back. It's very\ncommon to see sites include a huge third-party resource, and then end up using a\nvery minimal portion of it, say 5% e.g including a 20kb library only to end up\nusing a component that’s barely worth a kilobyte. That's usually not a great\nidea as most of these things can easily be implemented in-house with just a\nlittle bit extra work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"2-heavy-assets-and-resources\"\u003E2. Heavy assets and resources\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe all have that one big file on our sites – the one big JavaScript asset\nor the pretty 1MB image from Unsplash. JavaScript is on top of the list of\nfrontend resources that impact performance negatively, followed by images and\nreally, it’s difficult to keep track of these things when everyone is in a rush\nand hell-bent on results so we under-prioritize or forget about optmizing for\nperformance, something that affects our users directly. Users know when your\nsite is slow, they also know most times what sites consume a lot of their mobile\ndata.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEngineers write code and craft experiences they find pleasing which more often\nthan not is at the expense of the user — forgetting what the user needs and what\nthey perceive to be a great experience. The user has no idea how fancy your code\nis or what shiny new tech you're using, they just want to be able to use your\nproduct and have a great experience doing that. And so, if your site is not\naccessible quickly, you do not even get the chance to show anything to the user.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"3-excessive-http-requests\"\u003E3. Excessive HTTP Requests\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGet! Post! Frontend developers, we love to do that a lot: consuming APIs and all\n— it’s fun actually, being able to communicate with a web server, that’s pretty\nincredible, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, yes, it is but sure comes at a cost. Sending requests back and forth can\nquickly become overwhelming for a web server to handle. Imagine for a moment\nthat you’re going to get a snack one day at the office and then, a superior\ncalls and says “hey, on your way, please get me some venti iced skinny hazelnut\nmacchiato, sugar-free syrup, extra shot, light ice, no whip coffee”. Extremely\nconfusing, yeah?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar can happen with your server when making requests. If you observe from\nthat order, the entire purpose and what matters to you the most is getting your\nsnack, just the way your users want to \u003Cem\u003Euse\u003C\u002Fem\u003E your product — they want to satisfy\nthemselves. Too bad their superior (engineers in this case) took that privilege\naway from them. You know how tough it can be to say no to that – same way\nthe server can’t say no to your multiple requests. It just must (or at least\nattempt to) process the requests regardless of how complicated it is.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYour user might not need all the junks and stuff you’re fetching for them on the\ninitial load, they need what matters, and you’re in place to answer those\nquestions. Identify the things you’d want to have on your screen quickly if you\nwere the user.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"4-poor-code-quality\"\u003E4. Poor Code Quality\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone likes to hop on their computer to start writing code which often gets\nus distracted to the point we forget to ask ourselves essential questions like\n“Am I doing it the right way?”, “Can this be done better?”, “What are the\nimplications of doing it this way?”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot from the code quality can affect the performance of your site or product\nas an entity. Whether you’re implementing a functionality that should take 10\nlines of code in 50 lines, there’s so much dead code, or you’re just writing the\ncode or using a tool in a way that it’s much slower to function; they all impact\nperformance. For example, having excessive unused code bumps up file sizes which\ncould delay HTTP requests and in turn, affect performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, all the points listed previously in one way or the other fall under the\nquality of code you’re delivering and how knowledgeable a developer might be\nwith regards to performance. Your JavaScript, CSS, HTML and other applications\non the backend contribute to performance directly or indirectly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some industry standards and practices that should be followed while\nbuilding sites. Don’t write code that “just works™”. You should consider if\nyou’re actually solving that problem in the most efficient way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"5-inadequate-server-resources\"\u003E5. Inadequate server resources\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne critical factor often overlooked is the capabilities of the web server\nbehind a frontend. Nearly all articles and discussions about performance are\nusually focused on the frontend. Now, while that isn't wrong as most of the work\nis usually on the frontend, the server that powers a frontend can also greatly\naffect overall performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, sure, you could have a pretty fast frontend but if your server fails to\nrespond on time, the frontend never even makes it. So, what do I mean? Some\nservers have very high \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fweb.dev\u002Ftime-to-first-byte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ETTFB\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (Time to First\nByte) which is the time it takes for the client get the first byte of response\ndata from a server after an HTTP request, and so if that server's hardware (CPU,\nRAM etc) is inferior or insufficient and it takes long (more than 600ms on an\naverage network) to get a response for just the main document request, that's a\nprolonged page load and so your user just stares at a blank screen for seconds\nwith no sign of progress which can be really frustrating. Now, even when we get\na response for that main document request, subsequent resources like scripts,\ncss and images (all of which point to the server) still have to get their first\nbyte of response data and fully download which can really slow things down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that you have a clearer view on why performance matters and the several\nfactors that influence performance, including a few instances of not-so-good\npractices, in the final part of this series, we’ll talk about known and tested\nstrategies to tackle these problems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, how we build what we build matters because that’s a huge part of the\nproduct no matter what it's later transformed to. That’s what we serve users,\nand so priority should be given to what matters to the user, and not how quickly\nwe can achieve something that might not be the best experience for users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"further-reading-and-resources\"\u003EFurther Reading and Resources…\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcsswizardry.com\u002F2018\u002F11\u002Fcss-and-network-performance\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ECSS and Network Performance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\nby Harry Roberts\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@addyosmani\u002Fthe-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EThe Cost of JavaScript in 2018\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\nby Addy Osmani\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdevelopers.google.com\u002Fweb\u002Ffundamentals\u002Fperformance\u002Fspeed-tools\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EHow To think About Speed Tools\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\non the Google Developers Blog\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=4bZvq3nodf4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EProgressive Performance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Alex\nRussell\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n","cover_image":null},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"9d8347b1cb8f5e39ffc53576221f2052","path":"\u002Fweb-performance-the-big-picture\u002F"}},{"node":{"id":"943671e5cfd598b2d617ea5fed9adb35","path":"\u002Fweb-performance-the-problems\u002F"}}]}},"context":{}};(function(){var s;(s=document.currentScript||document.scripts[document.scripts.length-1]).parentNode.removeChild(s);}());</script><script src="/shelf/assets/js/app.01dd7f2f.js" defer></script><script src="/shelf/assets/js/page--src--templates--post-vue.048b1f8c.js" defer></script>
