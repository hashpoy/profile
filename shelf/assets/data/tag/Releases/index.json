We have been working on it for a year\nand will have a beta ready soon. You can expect this baby to grow up fast!</p>\n<p>We think <strong>Gridsome</strong> is a missing piece to the Vue.js ecosystem. What Gatsby.js\ndoes for React.js is a game changer in how we build websites. React.js is\nexcellent, but we think Vue.js is more approachable for most web designers and\ndevs getting started with JAMstack. Gridsome is the Vue.js alternative to\nGatsby.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Gridsome</strong> you get a <strong>universal GraphQL layer</strong> for all your connected\ndata sources. It's like a single source of truth for your website data ready to\nbe used in any page or components. Connect to any CMS or APIs like Google\nSpreadsheet, Airtable, Instagram Feed, local markdown files, etc.</p>\n<p>Here is an example on how to query posts from the GraphQL layer in a page:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Layout</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Latest blog posts<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ul</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n      <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>li</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">v-for</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>edge in $page.allWordPressPost.edges<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">:key</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>edge.node.id<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n        {{ edge.node.title }}\n      <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ul</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>Layout</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>page-query</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  query Blog { allWordPressPost (limit: 5) { edges { node { _id title } } } }\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>page-query</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>You don't need to know GraphQL or Vue to get started with Gridsome - It's a\ngreat way to get introduced to both.</p>\n<p>The GraphQL layer and all the data can be explored in a local GraphQL\nplayground. The playground is usually located at\n<code>https://localhost:8080/___explore</code> when a Gridsome development project is\nrunning.</p>\n<h4 id=\"perfect-scores-on-google-lighthouse---automagically-\">Perfect scores on Google Lighthouse - automagically üíö</h4>\n<p>One of the main goals of Gridsome is to make a framework that let you build\nwebsites that are optimized \"out-of-the-box.\" It follows the\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PRPL-pattern by Google.</a>\nYou don't need to be a performance expert to make fast websites with Gridsome.\nYour site gets almost perfect scores on Google lighthouse out-of-the-box. These\nare some of the performance steps that Gridsome takes care of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image compressing &#x26; lazy-loading ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>\n<li>CSS &#x26; JS minification ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>\n<li>Code-splitting ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>\n<li>HTML compressing ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>\n<li>Critical CSS (Plugin) ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>\n<li>Full PWA &#x26; Offline-support (plugin) ‚ö°Ô∏è</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"a-better-way-to-build-websites\">A better way to build websites</h4>\n<p>Gridsome is built for the JAMstack workflow - a new way to build websites that\ngives you better performance, higher security, cheaper hosting, and a better\ndeveloper experience. Generate prerendered (static) pages at build time for\nSEO-purpose and add powerful dynamic functionality with APIs and Vue.js.</p>\n<p>We believe the SSGs / JAMstack trend is just getting started. When you have\nfirst started to make websites this way there is no way back. You feel almost\n\"dirty\" when going back to a traditional WordPress / CMS setup.</p>\n<p>Try running the new Chrome Lighthouse (Audit tab in Developer tools) on a\nWordPress site - It is impossible to get good scores even with the best caching\nplugins and hosting. With Gridsome you don't even need caching plugins. Website\noptimization is taken care of at build time.</p>\n<p>This is what we think is very exciting and is why we are building Gridsome. It\nis the <strong>perfect SPA &#x26; PWA front-end solution</strong> for any headless CMS or content\nAPIs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"whats-next\">Whats next</h4>\n<p>In the next couple of months we're going to continue to improve the docs, create\ntutorials, add more source &#x26; transformer plugins and fix bugs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"contribute-to-gridsome\">Contribute to Gridsome</h4>\n<p>We're currently just two brothers working on this, so any contribution is very\nwelcome. We're passionate about building a faster web and make website building\nfun again.</p>\n<p>You can also support us by giving\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/stargazers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a GitHub star ‚òÖ</a> and spread\nthe word :)</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
