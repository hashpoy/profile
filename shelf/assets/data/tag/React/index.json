It enables the creation of native mobile\napps for iOS and Android from a single codebase. React Native makes it\nsimple to construct vibrant, engaging, and high-performing mobile apps.\nIn this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a\nsimple calculator using React Native, enabling you to apply the fundamentals\nof React Native development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"steps-to-create-react-native-application\">Steps to Create React Native Application</h2>\n<p>Step 1: Create a react native application by using this command\n<code>npx create-expo-app engineering-calculator-app</code></p>\n<p>Step 2: After creating your project folder, i.e. engineering-calculator-app, use the following command to navigate to it:\n<code>cd engineering-calculator-app</code></p>\n<p>Step 3: Open the App.js file.

It is necessary to devise a user interface (UI) comprising buttons for every digit and operation, alongside a display region for presenting the input and outcome. JavaScript functions can be employed to execute button interactions and carry out the required computations, thereby implementing the calculator’s logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-reading-and-resources\">Further Reading and Resources…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/work/engineering-calculator-app\">Engineering Calculator App</a>\nby Hash Poy</li>\n</ul>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
