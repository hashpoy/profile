It has become alarming how\nmany slow sites are on the web today, one of the reasons being the drastic shift\nof the web from a document-centric platform to a much more dynamic application\nplatform — the web is more powerful than ever, making it possible for users to\nget virtually any experience on the web — and that’s awesome, really.</p>\n<p>However, the web really is getting <em>slower</em>. It’s quite unfortunate that a lot\nof web teams and businesses just want a “magical solution” not realizing there’s\nno one antidote to poor performance of sites; there’s no one tech or approach\nthat’s going to make websites or the web platform as a whole fast automagically,\nwhich is why in my opinion, engineering teams should prioritize performance at\nevery phase of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_sprint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">design sprint</a>\nfor a product.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll be talking about why web performance really matters. So,\nlet’s dive right in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-performance-matters\">Why Performance matters</h2>\n<p>In one word, performance is about your <strong>users</strong>. Users. That’s why performance\nmatters. You’re building a product for people to use it, right? Whether you’re\nbuilding your portfolio, a news site, or a more dynamic experience like\nFacebook, you want people to use your stuff; and users in a lot of cases means\nsuccess, same way, success means profit if it’s a business!</p>\n<p>However, for people to interact seamlessly with your application or website, it\nhas to be accessible. Note that “accessible” here is more about showing content\nto your users quickly at least, and if possible, making the most basic feature\nwork. Diving deeper, optimizing performance for users means providing a great\n<strong>user experience</strong> overall. Let’s see how doing this is of benefit to our\nbusinesses and products.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-performance-meets-user-experience\">Web Performance meets User Experience</h3>\n<p>Now that we know a little about why performance matters, let’s talk more about\nhow great performance and poor performance impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Great performance means great user experience; great user experience translates\nto retaining users, and that means more users! You want people to go to your\nsite and do whatever the site was made for. If it’s an e-commerce site, you want\npeople to go there, sign up, and buy or sell stuff. If it’s a business, you want\nusers to use your product, talk about it, share it, bring more users, and get\nmore revenue. Performance plays a great role in this because:</p>\n<p>If your site is slow to load or make the most basic feature possible to use,\nyour users get tired of waiting and discouraged. Nobody wants to spend the whole\nday waiting for your site or app to load to be able to perform a task, because,\nremember, it’s the world wide web: for the most part, there are alternatives to\nyour product, you have competitors. So, once a user thinks your platform would\nto take too much of their time, they want to leave and go to another site that\noffers close to or exactly what your site offers.</p>\n<p>Also, in rare cases where there’s no alternative to your product, the users\neither get frustrated up to the level they want to quit your platform totally,\nor they just leave your site and go somewhere else, and that can be bad for\nbusiness.</p>\n<p>Again, <strong>poor performance means more cost for the users</strong> — Yes, cost. We know\nthe web is becoming a\n<a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mobile-dominant platform</a>.\nMobile means movable — the users can take the web with them wherever they go,\nand as such, they can’t determine network conditions or expect to get a certain\nnetwork quality in such situations. So, your user might have no choice other\nthan to access your site on a 2G network. If your site is not optimized for such\nconditions, the user becomes increasingly tired of trying to access it because\nof the time spent and the cost of trying subsequently over such conditions. Note\nthat “cost” also includes real cost for data plans.</p>\n<p><em>On the contrary…</em></p>\n<p>Great performance can be perceived as a site that delivers what matters quickly:\nthe user gets to your site, for example, a social networking app optimized for\npoor network and hardware conditions — which of course requires deliberate\ncommitment by the engineering and product team as a whole at every process.\nImagine your user can view at least 10% of <strong>relevant content</strong> (useful-to-user\ncontent) on your app (maybe text posts from friends without images), or the user\ngets a very minimal version of your site on a poor network, take\n<a href=\"http://m.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">m.facebook.com</a> for example. That’s an awesome\nexperience because even if the user is engaged with &#x3C;10% of your platform, it’s\nmuch better than losing the user totally, which is less than, or sometimes 0%.\nThis way, the user can interact with your app, and of course, instills in the\nmind of your users that your site is always a go-to no matter the network\ncondition. That makes better user experience and more profit for the business.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look quickly at some case-studies on how performance has either\nimpacted positively or negatively in conversion rates and revenue on products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"case-studies\">Case Studies</h2>\n<p><strong>Where Performance Optimization has helped</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/insights-inspiration/case-studies/zitmaxx-wonen-building-faster-mobile-site-pagespeed-insights-test-my-site/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">By reducing their load time to 3 seconds, Furniture retailer</a>,\nZitmaxx Women saw conversion jump <em>50.2%</em>.
